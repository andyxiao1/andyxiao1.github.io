# About Me

Hi! I'm Andy, a junior at the University of Pennsylvania.

I'm currently pursuing a B.S.E. in Computer Science through the School of Engineering and minoring in Statistics through Wharton and Engineering Entrepreneurship. I worked as a UI Engineer Intern at LinkedIn last Summer and will be working as a Quant Dev Intern at Akuna Capital this Summer.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or just want to chat!
