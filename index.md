# About Me

Hi! I'm Andy, a Senior at the University of Pennsylvania.

I'm currently majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Statistics through Wharton. I've previously worked in SWE and Quant roles at Akuna Capital, LinkedIn, and Tesla. Next Summer, I'll be an Algorithm Engineer Intern at Hudson River Trading. I also currently work at a startup called rideBelay!

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or just want to chat!
