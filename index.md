# About Me

Hi! I'm Andy, an incoming Senior at the University of Pennsylvania.

I'm currently pursuing a B.S.E. in Computer Science through the School of Engineering and minoring in Statistics through Wharton and Engineering Entrepreneurship. I currently work as a SWE intern at Tesla and have previously worked as a Quant Dev intern at Akuna Capital and a UI Engineer intern at LinkedIn.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or just want to chat!
