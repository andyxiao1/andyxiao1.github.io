# About Me

Hi! I'm Andy, a sophmore at the University of Pennsylvania.

I'm currently pursuing a B.S.E. in Computer Science through the School of Engineering and minoring in Statistics through Wharton and Engineering Entrepreneurship.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or just want to chat!
