# About Me

Hi! I'm Andy, a sophmore at the University of Pennsylvania.

I'm currently pursuing a B.S.E. in Computer Science through the School of Engineering and minoring in Statistics through Wharton and Engineering Entrepreneurship. I will be working as a UI Engineer Intern at LinkedIn this Summer in Sunnyvale, CA.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or just want to chat!
